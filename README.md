# Angbogged

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.4.

This is a basic implementation of a boggle-style game in angular. This was written to familiarize myself with angular, and is currently woefully incomplete. See src/app/TODO.txt for details.

In particular, there's quite a bit of CSS work (and adding images) to be done to get it feeling really nice.

However, given that it's more-or-less playable now I'm moving on to other frontends.
